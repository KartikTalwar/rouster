Rouster.is_a?('abstraction layer for interacting with Vagrant managed virtual machines')
=> true

It was conceived as the functional test answer to RSpec when Salesforce began rolling out [Puppet](http://www.puppetlabs.com), as many examples and comments will attest, but it can be used for much more.

The first implementation was in Perl, called [Salesforce::Vagrant](http://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceVagrant). Salesforce::Vagrant is functional, but new functionality may or may not be ported back.
